# Turva

**Clinical safety documentation brought into the 21st Century** <!-- markdownlint-disable-line MD036 -->

Clinical Safety is a laborious, dull and slow process. On the other side of this, clinical safety is paramount to ensure that harm does not come to the patients that we look after. In other industries great harm can come from this combination of dull but safety critical processes. Just look at the aviation industry, where the dull but critical processes of flight safety checks and maintenance are now supported by digital systems that ensure compliance and safety. Turva has taken the task of planning, documenting and managing clinical safety and made it a digital process that is easy to use, quick to complete and ensures that the documentation is always up to date and compliant with the latest standards.
